# Wikipedia Scraper Script and Unit Tests

This project contains a Python script that scrapes information from Wikipedia for a given search keyword. It fetches the title, description, and the first image from the infobox (if available) for the search result. Additionally, there are unit tests to validate the scraper for specific search terms like "pokemon", "mario", "warcraft", and "zelda".

## Files in the Repository

1. **`activity_1_2.py`**: This is the main script that fetches information from Wikipedia for a given search term. It can be run from the command line or executed directly to prompt the user for input. The script uses the following key components:
   - **`requests`** to fetch the Wikipedia page HTML.
   - **`BeautifulSoup`** from `bs4` to parse the HTML and extract relevant information.
   - **`PIL`** (Python Imaging Library) to handle and display images.
2. **`unit_test_activity_1_2.py`**: This is the unit test script that uses `pytest` to validate the functionality of the Wikipedia scraper. It includes tests for common search terms like "pokemon", "mario", "warcraft", and "legend of zelda".

3. **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the list of Python dependencies needed to run the script and tests.
