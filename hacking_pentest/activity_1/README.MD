# Hacking and Pentesting Activities

## Wikipedia Scraper Script and Unit Tests

This project contains a Python script that scrapes information from Wikipedia for a given search keyword. It fetches the title, description, and the first image from the infobox (if available) for the search result. Additionally, there are unit tests to validate the scraper for specific search terms like "pokemon", "mario", "warcraft", and "zelda".

## Files in the Repository

1. **`activity_1_2.py`**: This is the main script that fetches information from Wikipedia for a given search term. It can be run from the command line or executed directly to prompt the user for input. The script uses the following key components:
   - **`requests`** to fetch the Wikipedia page HTML.
   - **`BeautifulSoup`** from `bs4` to parse the HTML and extract relevant information.
   - **`PIL`** (Python Imaging Library) to handle and display images.
2. **`unit_test_activity_1_2.py`**: This is the unit test script that uses `pytest` to validate the functionality of the Wikipedia scraper. It includes tests for common search terms like "pokemon", "mario", "warcraft", and "legend of zelda".

3. **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the list of Python dependencies needed to run the script and tests.

## Metasploit Vulnerability Exploitation Script

This project contains a Python script designed to exploit a vulnerability in a Metasploitable 2 machine using the Metasploit Framework. The vulnerability targeted is the vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor exploit. The Python script uses the pymetasploit3 library to connect to the Metasploit RPC server, execute the exploit, and perform commands on the compromised system.

1. **`activity_1_1.py`**: This is the main script used to automate the exploitation process. It connects to the Metasploit RPC server using the MsfRpcClient and automates the execution of the vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit. Once a session is created, it executes a series of commands, such as whoami, ls, and creates a file named hacked.txt in the victim's /tmp/ directory.

   Key components:

   - **`pymetasploit3`** to interface with Metasploit.
     Automation of exploit setup and session management.
     Execution of post-exploitation commands on the victim machine.

   - **`requirements.txt`**: This file contains the Python dependencies required for the activity_1_1.py script to work. These include pymetasploit3 and other associated libraries.
